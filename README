A collection of my solutions aimed to minimize the number of iterations requied to solve the problems.


The code in this repository is intentionally unreadable because I don't want to spoil the joy of discovery when you figure out a fast mathematical solution. In fact, I would suggest the reader to figure out a solution as the trill you get when you find it is priceless.
